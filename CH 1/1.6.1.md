# 1.6.1 Exercises

1. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
    geom_bar()
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()
  ggsave("mpg-plot.png")

2. What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files would work in ggsave()?
