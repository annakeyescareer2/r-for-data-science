# 1.4.3 Exercises

1. Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

2. How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
    geom_bar(color = "red")

  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "red")

3. What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?

4. Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?
